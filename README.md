# Why memes matter?

* Social media is becoming increasingly abundant in memes which are mostly derived from news, popular TV shows and movies making them capable of conveying ideas that the masses can understand readily.
* Today memes are shared in numerous online communities and are not only limited to one language. It is therefore imperative to study this emerging form of mass communication.
* Although they are mostly for amusement and satire, memes are also being used to propagate controversial, hateful and offensive ideologies.
* Since it is not feasible to manually inspect such content it is important to build systems that can process memes and segregate them into appropriate categories.
